AES Implementation:

- typedef Struct State: contains only a 4x4 char array. It is intended to hold
bytes from the inputfile, and the intermediary data during the algorithm's
execution.

- typedef Struct Word: contains only a 4x1 char array. It is intended to hold
a 32-byte word for manipulation during Key Expansion. This was created for ease
of conceptualizing the 32-byte word operations that take place during
Key Expansion since that process operates on columns.

- state_array: When inputfile is read in, readStates() creates an array of
pointers to 4x4 "state arrays", thus making state_array a double pointer.
state_array is then passed to the main encrypt() function which then can pass
that into the four sub-routines. In other words, state_array is the entry point
to accessing the state arrays during encryption and decryption. Each 4x4
state array contains 16 bytes of data, one per entry in the array. When
inputfile is initially read into state arrays, it is read in column major order;
i.e. the first byte goes into [0][0], the second byte goes into [1][0], the
third byte goes into [2][0], the fifth byte goes into [0][1], etc.

- encrypt(): We essentially implemented the pseudocode for Cipher() in the NIST
(p. 15). This function calls on the four main sub-routines - addRoundKey(),
shiftRows(), mixColumns(), and subBytes() - in the same order as shown in the
pseudocode.

- rotWord(): Takes in a Word in form {ABCD} where A, B, C, D are
bytes. Then, a Word in the form {BCDA} is returned.

- subWord(): Takes in a Word in form {ABCD} where A, B, C, D are bytes. Each
byte is comprised of two nibbles X, Y in the form {XY}. Using simple bitwise
operations, X and Y are obtained from each byte. Then, nibble X is used as the
row index and nibble Y is used as the column index in order to index into the
pre-defined S-box, aes_sbox, to obtain a new byte. That new byte replaces the
byte {XY} in the original Word. Once all 4 bytes A, B, C, D perform this
substitution, the new Word is returned.

- Key Expansion: When the key is read in, it must be expanded into a
Key Schedule. The Key Schedule is a large array that has size n equal to the
(number of rounds Nr plus 1) times the keysize in bytes Nb * 4
[n = (Nb * 4)(Nr + 1)]. Columns in the Key Schedule are generated by two main
operations on Words (defined above) - rotWord() and subWord(). We then
implemented the pseudocode for KeyExpansion() from the NIST (p. 20).

- addRoundKey(): Takes in the state_array and "adds" it to Words (columns) from
the Key Schedule. This "addition" is really a bitwise XOR operation. This is
performed as follows: The State array passed to this function is in the form
{W0 W1 W2 W3} where W0, W1, W2, and W3 are Words (columns). Each Word is in
form {ABCD} where A, B, C, and D are bytes. Then, a word W is obtained from the
Key Schedule according to the formula W = (current_round*Nb) + WordNum where
WordNum = 0, 1, 2, or 3 for W0, W1, W2, or W3 respectively.

- shiftRows(): This function rotates bytes left in the state arrays
cyclically. The number of positions to be rotated corresponds to the row number;
i.e. entries in the 0th row move by 0 positions, entries in the 1st row
move by 1 position, entries in the 2nd row move by 2 positions, and entries
in the 3rd row move by 3 positions.

- mixColumns(): 

- subBytes(): This function substitutes the bytes from the state array with
bytes from the aes_sbox. aes_sbox is manually copied into our program file
to match the S-box shown in the NIST (p. 16) rather than being generated
according to the algorithm in the NIST (p. 15). The substitution scheme is as
follows: for each byte {XY} in the state arrays, index into the S-box using
nibble X as the row index and nibble Y as the column index to find the byte
with which you will replace. Each byte is read in as a char, and then a
few simple bitwise operations are used to obtain nibble X and nibble Y by 
themselves.

- decrypt(): Like encrypt(), we essentially copied the pseudocode for
InvCipher() in the NIST (p. 21). We chose not to implement the EqInvCipher()
defined on p. 25 of the NIST. This function takes in the key size (to determine
how many rounds to execute) and a pointer to the state_array. It then
performs the four main inverse sub-routines - invAddRoundKey(), invShiftRows(),
invMixColumns(), and invSubBytes() - in the order shown in the NIST for
InvCipher().

- invShiftRows(): This function rotates bytes right in the state arrays
cyclically. The number of positions to be rotated corresponds to the row number;
i.e. entries in the 0th row move by 0 positions, entries in the 1st row
move by 1 position, entries in the 2nd row move by 2 positions, and entries
in the 3rd row move by 3 positions.

- invSubBytes(): This function substitutes the bytes from the state array with
bytes from the inv_aes_sbox. inv_aes_sbox is manually copied into our program 
file to match the Inverse S-box shown in the NIST (p. 22) rather than being 
generated at runtime. The substitution scheme is as follows: for each byte {XY} 
in the state arrays, index into the Inverse S-box using
nibble X as the row index and nibble Y as the column index to find the byte
with which you will replace. Each byte is read in as a char, and then a
few simple bitwise operations are used to obtain nibble X and nibble Y by 
themselves.
